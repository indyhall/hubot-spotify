h1. Hubot-Spotify

This is a fork of davevanleeuwen's "hubot-spotify":https://github.com/davidvanleeuwen/hubot-spotify for getting the current song played at Indy Hall through Slack. In the future perhaps there will be a command to add a song to a playlist and maybe other stuff.

h2. Setup
* OSX (mac mini / server)
* Spotify
* Hubot

h2. Install dependencies
* @npm install sh@
* @npm install spotify@

h2. Current commands
* @current song@ - Shows what song I'm currently playing",

h2. Run Hubot with Hubot-Spotify locally?

#1 place this in your ~/.bash_profile (Slack adapter env vars)
export HUBOT_SLACK_TOKEN=token
export HUBOT_SLACK_TEAM=team
export HUBOT_SLACK_BOTNAME=slackbot

#2 install node, npm and clone hubot
brew install node
curl http://npmjs.org/install.sh | sh
clone git://github.com/github/hubot.git

#3 install the Hubot-Slack adapter
npm install hubot-slack --save

#4 go to the hubot/scripts folder and get the hubot-spotify scripts in there (git pull or just download)
git://github.com/indyhall/hubot-spotify

#5 install the dependencies for hubot-spotify
npm install sh
npm install spotify

#6 run hubot with slack
bin/hubot -a slack -n slackbot

#7 figure out the best way to start Hubot on machine boot/Hubot failure
TBD!
